# Arduino 0.0-Hello World
## This is our initial programming assignment for *Introduction to Robotics*.  The purpose of any "Hello World" program has always been to demonstrate the ability to use a programming interface.  The roots of this activity go back to a programming book written in 1978 called [The C Programming Language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_C_Programming_Language).  You will use this assignment as a chance to set up our programming environment, run your code to the Arduino and submit your finished assignment here on GitHub.

### **IMPORTANT: Before you start using your Chromebook to write code, be sure that your keyboard is set to "US", not "INTL"**

Like this:
![US](https://github.com/WHS-Robotics-Classes/images/blob/main/Screenshot%202021-01-20%20at%201.17.59%20PM.png?raw=true)

NOT This:
![INTL](https://github.com/WHS-Robotics-Classes/images/blob/main/Screenshot%202021-01-20%20at%201.17.31%20PM.png?raw=true)

To change your keyboard configuration, click on the "INTL" label and select "US Keyboard" under Input Methods.

### For all programming assignments in this class you will do the following:
1. Read the README.md file provided in the assignment repository for instructions.
2. Copy any starter code provided for you (Starter.ino file) into the [Arduino Web Editor](https://create.arduino.cc/editor).
3. Modify the code according to the instructions for the assignmnet.
4. Test the code on your Arduino.
5. Debug code if necessary.
6. Create a new file in the assignment repository with the appropriate name.
7. Click the "Commit Changes" button at the bottom to submit.

Since this assignment is more about testing out your IDE and your ability to run code to the Arduino, this will be a simple assignment.  Specific instructions are listed Below:
1. Be sure to read this entire document before starting your work.  View the image below so you understand what you will be making.
2. Open the [Arduino web editor](https://create.arduino.cc/editor) which is a part of our school license.  There is also a free version of this but it has some limitations which will make it difficult to use for later assignments.  You also need to install the Chrome app from the web store [here](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/codebender-app/magknjdfniglanojbpadmpjlglepnlko?hl=en).
3. Go to the Starter.ino file (above) in this repository.  Copy all of that code into the [Arduino web editor](https://create.arduino.cc/editor) fully replacing the code that is there.
4. Modify line 4 so that it will print "Hello World" when the program runs.  (Put that phrase in quotes inside the parenthesis after `Serial.println`.)
5. Test the code.  
    - Connect your Arduino to your computer with the blue USB cable.  
    - Select "Arduino Uno" in the first pulldown.  
    - Be sure that the second pulldown shows the current USB.  It should say something like `/dev/tty/ACM0`  If you cannot access the pulldown, you need to install the Codebender App on Chrome by clicking the link to the right.

    - Click the "Upload" button (Right Arrow)
    - Click the "Monitor" button on the left sidebar.

   - Be sure the baud rate pulldown is at 9600 and click "Connect".
    - Verify that the correct message is printed by comparing your screen to the image below.
    
![hello](https://github.com/WHS-Robotics-Classes/Arduino_0.0-Hello_World/blob/main/hello.png?raw=true)
    
   - If it all worked skip to step 7.  If not, go to next step.
    
6. Debug the code and repeat step 5 until it works.  Jump down to the link in step 12 to look over the documentation for this function.
7. Click the link above that says "Arduino_0.0-Hello_World".

8. Select "Add File" and then "Create New File".
![add-file](https://github.com/WHS-Robotics-Classes/images/blob/main/add-file.PNG?raw=true)

![new-file](https://github.com/WHS-Robotics-Classes/images/blob/main/new-file.PNG?raw=true)

9. Name the file Hello_World.ino.
10. Copy the code into the code window.
11. "Commit New File".

![commit](https://github.com/WHS-Robotics-Classes/images/blob/main/commit.PNG?raw=true)

12. Read over the [`Serial.println()` documentation on the Arduino website](https://www.arduino.cc/reference/en/language/functions/communication/serial/println/) to make sure you understand what you just did.

### For an extra challenge see if you can do any of the following:
- Print other messages in the serial monitor.
- Print two messages side by side.
- Print the same message over and over again forever.
- Create a counter so that the serial monitor prints "Counting: " followed by a number that increases by one with every new line.  See below.
